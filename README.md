Source codes, schematics and docs for the DriveJR Project, version 2.0

DriveJR is an autonomous car prototype. The main unit can read environmental data such as temperature, humidity, air quality and more. It can follow another car/obstacle maintaining a constant distance. It can also avoid obstacles, do a 360 scan, lateral park by itself and can be remotely controlled from the Desktop/Mobile app developed using Unity Engine. Live video streaming is also available thanks to the raspberry pi camera module.

The main purpose of the project is to build a prototype car capable of collecting data from human-inaccessible places and in the same time simulate some of the key features of a self-driving car such as distance keeping and automatic lateral park.

This is the re-built version of DriveJR V.1.0. Since last year, I've rebuilt the chassis, improved the software and added some new parts such as the 1080p wireless camera and the 2axis robotic arm. This time, the project got an upgrade for the chassis, making it off-road ready.
